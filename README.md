# Stock-Analysis
## Analysis of Module 2 Stock Data
### Project Overview

This project was given to us by a financial advisor colleague who was in need of a faster way to analyze the stock performance, of a list of stocks, for a given year. While using pivot tables, could have accomplished the same obejective, the use of VBA scripting and automation has sped the process up significantly. This same VBA code will work for future years as well, provided that the data is in the same format.

### Results

This anlaysis shows that 2017 was a pretty good year for the sampled market as a whole; however, the execption to this is the stock with ticker "TERP". TERP had a 7.2% decrease in the stock price from the beginning of the year 2017 to the end of the year 2017. Every other stock listed had a positive return for the year 2017.

The Analysis fo the year 2018 tells a very different story. Only two stocks showed a positive return for the year 2018. These stocks are shown as tickers "ENPH" and "RUN".
